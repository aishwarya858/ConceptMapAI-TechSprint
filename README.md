# ConceptMapAI-TechSprint
TechSprint (Solo Poject) overview:

As a first semester student, I noticed how complex a few topics or subjects feel for students like me who have just entered Engineering. This is where ConceptMap AI comes into the picture. 
ConceptMap AI uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash to convert complex paragraphs and topics into simple and easy to understand study guides.

Features include:
1) Instant Summarization: Turns long paragraphs into a 5 key sub-points.

3) Secure Implementation: Uses Stremlit Secrets to protect API credentials

Tech Stack used:
1) AI- Google Gemini API
2) Frontend: Streamlit (Python)
3) Deployment: Streamlit Community Cloud

How to Run:
1) Clone the Repo
2) Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
